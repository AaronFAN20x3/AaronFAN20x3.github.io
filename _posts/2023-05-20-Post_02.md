# Post 002 - The wise seek to contain power (Save and Reload trained model)

---

When I ran some fast.ai Jupyter notebooks, I had to spend a long time fine-tuning deep learning models. At some point, I might train an awesome model probably. However, if I accidentally closed the notebook or the notebook was shut down at this time, I had to re-train these models, which might waste a lot of time. Thus, I was thinking about a way to save these well-performance models. At the same time, I can reload these models whenever I need to. I found that notebook (02-saving-a-basic-fastai-model.ipynb) mentioned a way to export the trained model.

After finishing the model training,

```python
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func('.',
    get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,
    label_func=is_cat,
    item_tfms=Resize(192))

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(3)
```

export it by using [learn.export()](https://docs.fast.ai/learner.html) as follows.

```python
learn.export('model.pkl')
```

However, this notebook didn't mention anything about reloading my model back. After searching, I found a new way to save and reload my model. Save my model by using [learn.save()](https://docs.fast.ai/learner.html).

```python
from fastai.losses import CrossEntropyLossFlat

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy, loss_func=CrossEntropyLossFlat())
learn.fine_tune(3)

# Save the latest trained model
learn.save('trained_model')
```

Reload my model by using [learn.load()](https://docs.fast.ai/learner.html). However, it is worth mentioning that I have to reload the training set to run the dls and vision_learner() before I reload the model. This method worked successfully and saved lots of time during the development of the program.

```python

from fastai.vision.all import *

dls = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]
).dataloaders(path)

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy, loss_func=CrossEntropyLossFlat())

# Reload the latest trained model
learn.load('Q2_trained_model')
```
