# Post 003 - Confusion Matrix

Confusion Matrix

During the [fast.ai lession](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html) from Jeremy Howard, he mentioned some explanations of the confusion matrix. Depending on the metrics used to train the model, the confusion matrix could show how or what category errors were made in the model. Fast.ai has a built-in function to generate a simple confusion matrix as follows:

```python
 # Generate the Confusion Matrix by using ClassificationInterpretation function
interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)
# Plot the Confusion Matrix
interp.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(8, 8))
```

Apply the [ClassificationInterpretation](https://docs.fast.ai/interpret.html) function from [fast.ai library](https://docs.fast.ai/interpret.html) to generate and plot the confusion matrix of the trained model. The example output would be like this:
