# About Me

My name is Xinchuan Fan, and I am a Final-year Electrical Engineering student at The University 
of Queensland. I excel at problem-solving and thrive in challenging situations, leveraging my 
ability to analyse problems from multiple perspectives to identify and implement the most 
effective solutions. I have a passion for applying my knowledge to real-world problem-solving, 
always eager to seize any opportunity for learning and growth. Iâ€™m graduating in mid-2023. 
Therefore, I am actively seeking a graduate program to further develop my skills in this sector 
and target to the grad position at the end of the program.
