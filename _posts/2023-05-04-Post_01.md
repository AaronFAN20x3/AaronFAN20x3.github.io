# Post 001 - Get Started Classifying Birds and Forests Using a fast.ai Deep Learning Classification Model
---
By following the fast.ai course - [Lesson 1](https://aaronfan20x3.github.io/about.html), I could have the chance to run a deep learning classification model classifying birds and forests. The steps to implement this model were provided to us for research and learning as follows:
1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of "bird photos"
1. Use DuckDuckGo to search for images of "forest photos"
1. Fine-tune a pretrained neural network to recognise these two groups
1. Try running this model on a picture of a bird and see if it works.
