# Post 002 - The wise seek to contain power

---

When I ran some fast.ai Jupyter notebooks, I had to spend a long time fine-tuning deep learning models. At some point, I might train an awesome model probably. However, if I accidentally closed the notebook or the notebook was shut down at this time, I had to re-train these models, which might waste a lot of time. Thus, I was thinking about a way to save these well performance models. At the same time, I can reload these models whenever I need to. I found that notebook (02-saving-a-basic-fastai-model.ipynb) mentioned a way to export the trained model.

After finishing the model training,

```python
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func('.',
    get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,
    label_func=is_cat,
    item_tfms=Resize(192))

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(3)
```
export it by using [learn.export()](https://docs.fast.ai/learner.html) as follows.

```python
learn.export('model.pkl')
```
